Your pet is named Example and its age is 0.
Your pet's life stage is:  baby 
Example will age up in 5 day(s)!

Hunger:   100
Fun:      100
Hygiene:  100
Sleep:    100
Health:   100

Hint: Pay attention to the pet potrait! If one or more of your pet's needs is low, it will look unhappy!

There are seven options you can use every time the game asks what you would like to do:

Type 'f' or 'feed' to feed your pet. This restores hunger.
Type 'p' or 'play' to play with your pet. This restores fun.
Type 'c' or 'clean' to give your pet a bath. This restores hygiene.
Type 's' or sleep to send your pet to bed. This restores sleep.
Type 'h' or 'heal' to give your pet medicine. This restores health.
Type 'n' or 'none' to leave your pet to its own devices. It may do something that negatively or positively affects its needs.
Type 'help' to see this list of commands again.

Your pet's needs will be affected every time you take (or don't take!) action.
Your pet's health need is only adversely affected if it's hunger and/or hygiene is low, or from its own actions.
Your pet will age by one day every time it sleeps, whether you send it to bed or it passes out from lack of sleep.
Be especially mindful of your pet's stats near its birthday -- how you take care of it can determine its personality!
Take good care of your pet, and it will live a long and happy life! But if you neglect it...well...
